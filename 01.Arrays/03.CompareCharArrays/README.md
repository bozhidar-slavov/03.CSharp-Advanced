# Compare char arrays
Write a program that compares two `char` arrays lexicographically (letter by letter).

## Input
- On the first line you will receive the first `char` array as a string
- On the second line you will receive the second `char` array as a string

## Output
- Print `<` if the first array is lexicographically smaller
- Print `>` if the second array is lexicographically smaller
- Print `=` if the arrays are equal

## Constraints
- 1 <= **size of arrays** <= 128
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
