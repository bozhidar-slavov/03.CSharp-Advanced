# Number as array

## Description
Write a method that adds two positive integer numbers represented as arrays of digits (each array element `arr[i]` contains a digit; the last digit is kept in `arr[0]`).
Write a program that reads two arrays representing positive integers and outputs their sum.

## Input
- On the first line you will receive two numbers separated by spaces - the size of each array
- On the second line you will receive the first array
- On the third line you will receive the second array

## Output
- Print the sum as an array of digits (as described)
  - Digits should be separated by spaces

## Constraints
- Each of the numbers that will be added could have up to `10 000` digits.
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
