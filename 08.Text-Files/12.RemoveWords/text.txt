Computer software also called a program or simply software is a series of instructions that directs a computer to perform specific tasks or operations. Computer software consists of computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data (such as online documentation or digital media). Computer software is intangible, contrasted with computer hardware, which is the physical component of computers. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.
